NAME
    JSAN::Index::Data - A Data::Package for the SQLite JSAN Index

SYNOPSIS
      # Load the data package
      use JSAN::Indexer:Data;
  
      # Request the data it manages
      my $dbh = JSAN::Indexer::Data->get('DBI::db');

DESCRIPTION
    This is the distribution and package for the JSAN index.

    JSAN is the JavaScript Archive Network and can be located at
    <http://openjsan.org/>.

    "JSAN::Indexer::Data" is a Data::Package, a package with the sole
    purpose of integrating a "data product" into the CPAN namespace,
    abstracting away and encapsulating the implementation complexity so that
    all you need to do is request a the data from the class.

    It is versioned and installed separately from the things that will
    consume the data it provides. In this case JSAN::Index.

STATUS
    This distribution currently specificies the correct installation
    dependencies, and implements the correct code. However, I'm unsure how
    to actually control the installation location for the JSAN index.

    Advice is sought on upgrading the Makefile.PL or this class to get it
    downloaded and installed in a reliable place, and to update the download
    as needed.

METHODS
    This class implements the Data::Package API, and provides data in the
    form of a DBI::db object (a database connection).

    See the \SYNOPSIS above for the standard use.

TO DO
    - Check this actually works with the real database

    - Work out how to install to the correct place

    - Implement the Data::Package::Upgrade API once it exists

SUPPORT
    Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at

    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=JSAN-Index-Data>
