NAME
    JSAN::Index::Data - A Data::Package for the SQLite JSAN Index

SYNOPSIS
      # Load the data package
      use JSAN::Indexer:Data;
  
      # Request the data it manages
      my $dbh = JSAN::Indexer::Data->get('DBI::db');

DESCRIPTION
    This is the distribution and package for the JSAN index.

    JSAN is the JavaScript Archive Network and can be located at
    <http://openjsan.org/>.

    "JSAN::Indexer::Data" is a Data::Package, a package with the sole
    purpose of integrating a "data product" into the CPAN namespace,
    abstracting away and encapsulating the implementation complexity so that
    all you need to do is request a the data from the class.

    It is versioned and installed separately from the things that will
    consume the data it provides. In this case JSAN::Index and a range of
    other JSAN-related packages.

STATUS
    This distribution currently specificies the correct installation
    dependencies, and implements the correct code.

    It attempts to use the JSAN root path from the "JSAN_PREFIX" environment
    variable. If that does not exist, it will further guess that the current
    user has a ~/.jsan directory.

    Additional advice is sought on upgrading the Makefile.PL or this class
    to get it downloaded and installed in a reliable place, and to update
    the download as needed.

INSTALLING
    In order to install this, you are going to need to have an existing JSAN
    index database. At time of writing, with JSAN at version 0.02, this
    installs to $HOME/.jsan.index.sqlite

    You may need to run the following before attempting to install this
    package.

      cd ~
      mkdir .jsan
      cp .jsan.sqlite.index .jsan/index.sqlite

    Hopefuly this will be resolved soon, and everything will play together
    nicely. Give it time, JSAN is still young.

METHODS
    This class implements the Data::Package API, and provides data in the
    form of a DBI::db object (a database connection).

    See the \SYNOPSIS above for the standard use.

  dsn
    The "dsn" method provides direct access to the index database DSN

  file
    The "file" method returns the file path for the SQLite index database

  root
    The "root" method returns the JSAN root directory being used

TO DO
    - Check this actually works with the real database

    - Work out how to install to the correct place

    - Implement the Data::Package::Update API once it exists

SUPPORT
    Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at
